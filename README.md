# OpenNMS My Test Plugin


This plugin was generated by the OPA archetype and is used as test for getting info.

The generated plugin contains code examples to demonstrate how to create a:
* Karaf Shell Command (see StatsCommand & TopologyCommand)
* REST Endpoint (see WebhookHandler & WebhookHandlerImpl)
* Event Configuration Extension (see EventConfExtension)
* Alarm Lifecycle Listener (see AlarmForwarder)



Build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository using:

```
mvn clean install
```


From the OpenNMS Karaf shell:

```
cp assembly/kar/target/opennms-mytestplugin-plugin.kar /opt/opennms/deploy/
feature:install opennms-plugins-mytestplugin
```

```
bundle:watch *
```


Once installed, the plugin makes the following Karaf shell commands available:
* opennms-mytestplugin:stats
* opennms-mytestplugin:push-topology

You can also access the REST endpoint mounted by the plugin at `http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/mytestplugin/ping`
